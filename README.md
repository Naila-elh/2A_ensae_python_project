# Python project for ENSAE class *Python pour le data scientist* (Python for Data Science)

Coline Fouch√© and I did this assignment for our class [*Python pour le data scientist*](http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/ensae_teaching_cs/helpsphinx3/td_2a.html) during our second year at ENSAE. We were asked to find a dataset, apply 
Machine Learning algorithms, and discuss the results. We chose to work on a dataset of the United Nations General Debates,
available on [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/unitednations/un-general-debates).

## Description of the Jupyter notebooks
- Descriptive statistics.ipynb: Descriptive statistics of the speeches (most used words), for the countries permanent members of the UN council, and evolution of word frequency for France.
- Python-DS_El-Haouari_Fouche.ipynb: Final notebook sent for this course. The aim is use supervised learning algorithms to predict the country based on the speeches. This notebook includes our features selection (using TF-IDF), our models, and our results.
